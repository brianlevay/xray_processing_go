# X-Ray Image Processing for Cores at IODP

This software is intended to allow scientists to process x-ray images acquired from cores. It's designed around the initial setup used on the JOIDES resolution during Phase 1 of the X-Ray Imager Project.

## Installing and Running the Software
*coming soon*

## Remaining Tasks for Version 1.0:
* Test on Windows, run performance benchmarks
* Test on MacOS

## Future Changes if Time Allows:
* Add flexibility to handle cores in non-vertical orientation
* Add support for non-centered source
* Investigate automatic histogram bounds determination
* Investigate improved contrast enhancement algorithms
* Investigate improved core detection algorithms
* Overall performance improvements
* Possible add back limited pool of goroutines (one per file led to terrible performance!)
